    #  The purpose of this assignment was to develop a mobile application game representing a smart pet mobile application  #
    #      in which the user signs into the game or creates an account and then they choose a pet. After choosing a pet,    #
    #      the user is able to interact with their pet by feeding, bathing, clothing and playing with their pet. After      #
    #      reaching a certain level, the user is then able to use their pet to fight another pet and to see if they can win #
    #      the fight intensity is based upon the players level so the higher the level, the more intense the fight will be  #
    #      in the main scene of the fight, if the pet is not taken care of, then the pet will run away after 3 hours of not #
    #      being taken care of. If the pets health drains and the timer runs out, then the pet will die so make sure to take#
    #      care of you pet. The player is able to interact with the pet on the main scene by clicking any of the icons      #
    #      locate on the bottom portion of the main scene by either clicking or dragging to the screen. The result of these #
    #      actions will effect the status bars of the players health. On the title scene before choosing the egg to choose  #
    #      their pet, they can click the info button at the top left to view in game information to help them as well.      #
    #      the game is pretty straight forward even in the fight scene, the player will be faced with an opponent and in the#
    #      bottom right, there will be an atack bar of all the available attacks, these buttons are interactive so when     #
    #      user clicks on any of the buttons, they will directly affect the enemy you are facing. In the game over scenes,  #
    #      the user is able to view a few options: retry fight, back to main or exit(which will lead to the title scene     #
    #      in which the player can choose another pet) doing this however reset all the stats of the player including the   #
    #      level.                                                                                                           #
